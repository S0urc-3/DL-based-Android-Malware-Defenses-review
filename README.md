# Deep Learning for Android Malware Defenses

This is an updated survey fo deep learning-based Android malware defenses, a constantly updated version of the manuscript, ["Deep Learning for Android Malware Defenses: a Systematic Literature Review"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544968#) by Yue Liu, Li Li, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn and Yepang Liu. This paper has been accepted by **ACM Computing Surveys**.

> To the best of our knowledge, no systematic literature review focusing on deep learning approaches for Android Malware defenses exists. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 132 studies covering the period 2014-2021 were identified. Our investigation reveals that, while the majority of these sources mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 53 primary studies (40.1 percent) design defense approaches based on other scenarios. This review also discusses research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.

<h2 id="1"> Systematic review process and paper lists </h2>

We collected primary studies related DL-based Android malware defenses from a variety of sources (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, Springer, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar and Web of Knowledge). Only those studies related to deep learning-based Android malware defenses should be considered for further review;in addition, we proposed a quality appraisal criterion to obtain high-quality studies. 
The complete list of exclusion criteria and quality appraisal criterion is available at this [page](files/review_methodology.md).
After that, we obtained 132 relevant parimary studies.


<h2 id="2"> Paper structure </h2>
We uploaded our completed paper lists to Google Drive with detailed reviewed information.
